### Scenarios
Create at least three activities and/or tasks that demonstrate the envisioned functionality (i.e., features or menus) you are considering for your design solution. Therefore, you need to create at least three scenarios that illustrate your envisioned design solutions. Each scenario should be at least a paragraph long and include information about the key scenario components: context (setting, personas, goals), use cases (actions/tasks and events).

The scenario has two parts: why the persona wanted to do it (intention & goal) + how the persona successfully accomplished the goal. When you draft the scenario, you need to double-check how the persona would perceive/feel/act/evaluate (refer to the action model by D. Norman). To make sure the scenario is written for a persona’s success, you need to break down the storyline into the hero’s journey structure: challenges to reach the goal > frustration > possible solution > take an action to accomplish. Create a brief story blocks and track the user’s emotion and actions in a timeline (i.e., show a causality). It will make the journey map. Each of three scenarios, you need to create the journey map. So I will expect to see three journey maps if you suggest three features (=scenarios).


DESIGN SOLUTION: SOCIAL PAGE - TRENDING, HOT & NEW, BUSINESSES SHARING INFO, FRIENDS POSTING, MAP (LIKE SNAPMAPS)

1. See what restaurants are trending in a particular area


2. See if there are any promotions currently going on for a particular celebration (ie. National Ice Cream Day)


3. See what new restaurants there are
