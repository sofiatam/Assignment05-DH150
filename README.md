### Scenarios

**Scenario #1: See what restaurants are trending in a particular area**

As tourists, people like to see what restaurants are popular and/or trending in the particular area they are visiting. People want to enjoy the food that the locals are currently enjoying to get the authentic experience. Currently, to see these types of establishments, people consult sites such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, or Google, trust word-of-mouth, or just go wherever is most convenient for them. The user is frustrated because there is no central platform to see what is popular and where the locals are currently frequenting. The user can only see what restaurants have the most reviews; however, this may be outdated sometimes if a particular establishment used to be very popular, but recently fell off. To solve this problem, Yelp should create a map that can be toggled by several different filters. A "Trending" filter could be used to display "Hot & New" restaurants (current Yelp feature) as well as the restaurants that have been reviewed and checked into a lot recently. This "Trending" map would be useful for not only tourists, though, as locals could also utilize this tab to see what is new in the area. This map will allow users to easily see what restaurants are not only rated well, but *currently* rated well, which makes the process of finding a restaurant easier for tourists, as well as locals. This scenario applies to user personas like Tyler, who travels frequently to new places.

**Scenario #2: See business updates for particular occassions**

All throughout the year, there are national holidays for particular foods. Take National Ice Cream day, for example. Every year for National Ice Cream day, many establishments have promotions, like BOGO scoops. Although there are always tons of promotions for occassions like this, there is no easy place to see all of these deals. Currently, people read news articles that compile and share various promotions, but there is no easy way to see what establishments are close by. To solve this problem, the same map feature could be utilized. Businesses could post updates to their businesses, such as promotions, that could be viewed under this "Updates" map. Additionally, for holidays, businesses could use this feature to share their updated hours. This "Updates" map would alleviate the pain of searching for restaurant updates individually by compiling all relevant updates. This scenario would apply to all user personas, especially Kelly, who would like to know updates in hours so she can plan her day accordingly and stay productive.

**Scenario #3: See where your friends are currently eating**

People enjoy seeing what their friends are doing. As evidenced through platforms like Snap, Instagram, and Facebook, people frequently post live updates to their accounts (take stories, for example). Often, people posti pictures of food they are currently eating. However, it is not easy to see where they are eating because the original poster has to explicitly tag the location (on Instagram stories). The user also has to redirect to an external map to see where that particular restaurant is. This process is tedious and inefficient. To counter this inefficiency, Yelp should add a "Friends" filter/tab to the map feature I previously suggested. This feature would be similar to that of Snap Maps (Snapchat) in that it shares where your friends are currently eating. This map feature would be useful because if the food looks appetizing to the user in Yelp's "Friends" map, the user can remain in the app and directly see reviews for a particular restaurant. Keeping the entire food experience within one app will allow it to increase usage and popularity. This scenario would apply to user personas like Justine, who likes to see what her friends are always up to.
